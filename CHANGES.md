- Updated action `runner_type` from `run-python` to `python-script`

## v0.2.0

**BREAKING CHANGE**

The configuration in `config.yaml` has been flattened, and moved
to `config.schema.yaml`. 

Any older configuration will need to be updated. `hostname` and `port`
are no longer subsections under `master` - they are now top-level
configuration items. Similarly, `client_cert_path`, `client_cert_key_path`,
`ca_cert_path` are now top-level items, not under `auth`.

## v0.1.0

* Initial release
